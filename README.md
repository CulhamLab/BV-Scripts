# NeuroElf Installation
1.	Download the same version of NeuroElf that Kevin uses here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e9z4ckagqvh9pe1/AAAZbRWT3KmNtBIyw6vBqNOva?dl=1
1.	Extract the zip file
1.	In MATLAB, navigate to the extracted files and run “NeuroElf_v10_5153 –i” (without the quotation marks)
1.	After the initial install, you will be asked if you want to create brain files. Click yes. This process may take several minutes.
1.	Add the NeuroElf folder (with subfolders) to the MATLAB path if it wasn’t automatically added.
	1.	If you don’t have admin on the PC, you will need to either get admin privileges or re-add the folder to path each time that you open MATLAB.
